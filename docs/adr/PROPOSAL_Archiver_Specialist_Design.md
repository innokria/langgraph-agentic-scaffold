## Archiver Specialist Design

Completed: Aug 21 2025
Completed by: svc and Gemini Code Assist

Purpose & Role
The Archiver specialist is the final agent in a workflow. Its primary role is to take the completed work from other specialists, condense the messy conversational state into a clean final report, and signal the end of the process.

Think of it as the project manager who, after the creative team is done, gathers all the materials, writes a summary report, and files the project away. This cleanly separates the iterative "work" phase from the final "reporting" phase.

Core Responsibilities
State Condensation: It processes the final, often bloated, state object. Instead of leaving a long, repetitive message history, it creates a concise summary.

Artifact Aggregation: It scans the final state for any generated artifacts, such as html_artifact, json_artifact, system_plan, or plain text results.

Report Generation: It formats all the gathered information into a single, human-readable Markdown (.md) file. This report serves as the definitive output of the entire agentic run.

Termination Signal: It explicitly sets the next_specialist to a terminal value (e.g., __FINISH__), which tells the workflow runner to stop, preventing the kind of loop you observed.

Input & Output
Input: The Archiver receives the entire final state object from the specialist that completed the primary work (e.g., web_builder). It will look for keys like:

messages: The full conversation history.

system_plan: The plan generated by the architect.

html_artifact, json_artifact, text_artifact: The final outputs from various specialists.

error: Any errors that occurred.

Output:

A new artifact: archive_report, which is a well-structured Markdown string.

An updated state object: with the next_specialist flag set to __FINISH__.

## Example Report Structure (Markdown)
This is what the generated archive_report artifact could look like. It's designed to be a comprehensive summary of the job.

### üìÑ HTML Output (`index.html`)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <style>
        /* ... CSS from the final version ... */

## üí¨ Conversation Summary

1.  **Human:** Draw an Art Deco style 'hello world' webpage in a single html file.
2.  **Architect:** I have created a system plan: *Develop a single HTML file...*
3.  **Web Builder:** I have generated the HTML document based on the system plan.
