- If the user asks for a summary, provide a concise summary.
- If the user asks for sections, list the main sections.
- If the user asks to extract specific information, extract only that information.

Focus solely on the analysis task based on the full conversation. Do not add any conversational fluff or explanations unless the user's request explicitly asks for it. Your output should be the direct result of the analysis.
