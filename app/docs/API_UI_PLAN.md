## Proposal: Implement a FastAPI-based API and UI Layer
### Objective
To create a modern, intuitive, and robust interface for the `SpecialistHub` system, enabling external interaction and integration.
### Problem Statement
The system currently lacks a formal external interface, making it difficult to interact with programmatically, test end-to-end, or integrate with other services. All interaction is via local script execution.
### Proposed Solution
A four-phase plan is proposed:
1.  **Define API Contract:** Create an `openapi.yaml` specification to define the system's "front door." This includes synchronous (`/invoke`), streaming (`/stream`), and asynchronous (`/jobs`) endpoints.
2.  **Implement API Server:** Build a lightweight API server using the **FastAPI** framework. This server will act as the bridge between the public internet and the internal `LangGraph` application.
3.  **Develop Minimalist UI:** Create a simple, single-page web application (HTML/CSS/JS) that interacts with the defined API endpoints, providing a clean interface for testing and demonstration.
4.  **Integrate with Roadmap:** The API/UI development will run in parallel with core architectural work. The API contract will be defined first, allowing frontend and backend development to proceed independently.
### Architectural Impact
This proposal introduces a new, formal **Presentation/Interface Layer** to the system architecture. It decouples the core agentic logic from user interaction and establishes the system's public, versioned contract, which is essential for any production-grade application.
