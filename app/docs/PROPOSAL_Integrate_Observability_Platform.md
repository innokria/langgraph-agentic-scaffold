# PROPOSAL: Integrate an Observability Platform (LangSmith)

## Objective
To integrate the LangSmith platform into the application to provide full, end-to-end tracing and observability for all agentic graph executions.

## Rationale
As we move towards more complex architectures involving loops and multi-step tool use (as seen in the `deep_researcher` example), debugging via console logs becomes impossible. A dedicated observability platform is no longer a "nice-to-have" but a mandatory architectural component.

LangSmith will provide:
1.  **Visual Tracing:** A clear, interactive graph of the agent's execution path for every run.
2.  **Input/Output Logging:** Detailed inspection of the data flowing between nodes.
3.  **Error Analysis:** Rapid identification of which node failed and why.
4.  **Performance Monitoring:** Insight into latency and token usage for each step.

Implementing this *before* enabling loops is critical, as it will allow us to debug the looping logic as we build it.

## Implementation Plan
1.  **Dependency:** Add `langsmith` to the `requirements.txt` file.
2.  **Configuration:** Establish a `.env` file as the standard for configuration. This file will house the required environment variables: `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, and `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`.
3.  **Integration:** Ensure the application's entry point (`main.py`) loads the `.env` file at startup to enable tracing for all subsequent LLM calls from the (now Singleton) client.
