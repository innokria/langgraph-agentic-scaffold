# Requirements Proposal: Full LM Studio Integration

**Date:** August 9, 2025
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Phlogiston (AI Codebase Architect)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fully activating LM Studio as a primary "brains" LLM provider within the existing application architecture. The goal is to enable seamless integration, allowing the system to leverage LM Studio’s capabilities across all relevant modules and agents. This proposal builds upon the current implementation (primarily in `src/llm/clients.py` and `src/llm/factory.py`) and defines the necessary steps for complete activation.

## 2. Goals

*   **Seamless Integration:** LM Studio should function as a drop-in replacement for other LLM providers (Gemini, Ollama) with minimal code changes.
*   **Configurability:** The system should easily support different LM Studio models and configurations via environment variables.
*   **Robustness:** Ensure the integration is resilient to common issues like network connectivity problems or LM Studio server restarts.
*   **Observability:** Provide clear logging and metrics for monitoring LM Studio’s performance and usage.

## 3. Scope

This proposal covers the following areas:

*   Configuration validation and management.
*   Testing with representative use cases across key agents.
*   Documentation updates for developers and end-users.
*   Error handling and resilience mechanisms.

It does *not* include:

*   Major refactoring of existing agent logic beyond what is necessary to support LM Studio integration.
*   Implementation of advanced features specific to LM Studio (e.g., model offloading) – these can be considered in future iterations.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| **ID** | **Requirement Description**                                   | **Priority** | **Acceptance Criteria**                                                                |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR-001 | LM Studio base URL must be configurable via `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`. | High         | System correctly connects to the specified URL.                                       |
| FR-002 | LM Studio model name must be configurable via `LMSTUDIO_MODEL`.   | High         | System uses the specified model for all LM Studio requests.                             |
| FR-003 | The system should gracefully handle a non-responsive LM Studio server.| Medium       |  A timeout mechanism is implemented, and an informative error message is logged.        |
| FR-004 | All agents currently using `BaseLLMClient` must function correctly with LM Studio.| High         | Existing agent behavior remains consistent when switching to LM Studio as the provider.|
| FR-005 | Logging should include the LM Studio model name and base URL for easy debugging. | Medium       | Log messages clearly identify which requests are being sent to LM Studio.              |
| FR-006 | The `LMStudioClient` class must handle OpenAI-compatible chat completions.| High         |  The client can successfully send and receive chat completion requests from LM Studio.   |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Integration should not introduce significant performance overhead compared to other LLM providers.
*   **Maintainability:** The code should be well-documented and easy to understand for future maintenance.
*   **Scalability:**  The integration should scale with the overall system as usage increases.
*   **Security:** LM Studio communication should be secure (e.g., using HTTPS).

## 6. Technical Design Considerations

*   Leverage existing `LLMClientFactory` in `src/llm/factory.py` to instantiate `LMStudioClient`.
*   Utilize environment variables for configuration, providing flexibility and ease of deployment.
*   Implement a robust error handling mechanism with informative logging messages.
*   Consider using a dedicated testing suite to verify LM Studio integration across different agents.

## 7. Implementation Plan (Phases)

1.  **Configuration Validation:** Verify that environment variables are correctly parsed and used by the `LMStudioClient`. (Estimated: 4 hours)
2.  **Agent Integration & Testing:** Integrate LM Studio into key agents (e.g., data extractor, prompt specialist) and conduct end-to-end testing. (Estimated: 8 hours)
3.  **Error Handling & Resilience:** Implement timeout mechanisms and error handling for non-responsive LM Studio servers. (Estimated: 4 hours)
4.  **Documentation Update:** Update developer documentation to reflect the new integration and configuration options. (Estimated: 2 hours)

## 8. Dependencies

*   A running instance of LM Studio with an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
*   Access to the codebase in `src/llm`.
*   Basic understanding of Python and LLM concepts.

## 9. Success Metrics

*   All functional requirements are met, as verified by acceptance criteria.
*   Key agents function correctly with LM Studio without significant performance degradation.
*   The integration is well-documented and easy to maintain.
